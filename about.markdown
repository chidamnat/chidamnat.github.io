### Hi, I'm Chidam Gopal 

This is my personal site where I post about AI, ML, Data Science, LLM, agents, building intelligent systems and practical insights - with an emphasis on understanding systems from first principles and the fun part of making them work in practice.

I’m particularly interested in how reasoning, tools, and control flow come together to form reliable AI systems.

### Connect
I enjoy discussing AI, ML, agents, and designing intelligent systems, especially with people who like going a level deeper.
